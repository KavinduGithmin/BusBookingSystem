Bus Ticket Reservation System

A group project for Year 1 Semester 2 - Internet and Web Technologies (IWT) Module, where me and my teammates built a Online Bus Ticket Booking System.

Function
This system handles the passengers and bus agencies functionalities. On the passengers view, the user can register, then login themselves and search for available buses based on the departing and arriving bus stops and the date of travel. The bus agencies can similarly register and login themselves. They are allowed to add buses under their agency account, and add the schedules of the bus and other relevant information.

My Contribution

•	Created the Home and FAQ pages for the passenger

•	Allow passenger to Search routes and book tickets

•	Provide a verification code to the user once they're done
